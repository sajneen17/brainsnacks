A new Flutter project.

Create a custom button widget using the above widgets & components.
Text should be in center with user defined text content (what to show in button, e.g. Close, Cancel, Next etc) font size, color, line count, overflow etc.
There will be two same sized (20) icons on left and right side of the text, provided by user (IconData). They should have a user defined color.
Icons and the text should be aligned center-horizontally with a certain gap in both sides of the text.
Text should expand as needed and should show a overflow character (...) at end if there is not enough room for the text. icons in left(user defined) and right(may be an arrow icon)
Should do something (may be print something in console, or show a snack).
Create a simple List cell having user's circular image at left (you may use new properties of previously described widgets or use new widgets), and user's name at right. They should be aligned center-horizontally as well. Afterwards, use the newly created widget to populate ListView widget. Explore the performance for a large number of list cells in case of all the constructors of the ListView widget.
Same as 2, but use a gridview. This time only see the user's circular image as cell.
